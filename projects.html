													I find Bayesian inference very appealing because it forces us to confront
													what we know and do not know about the phenomena we are trying to model.
													Fortunately for me there is a one-to-one correspondence between molecular dynamics simulations
													and Bayesian inference. The same computational methods that are used to
													sample molecular configurations can be directly applied to sample
													the parameters of Bayesian models.

													Neural networks are very flexible function approximators and, when
													combined with Bayesian methods, offer the possiblity of performing
													robust inference on almost any problem. Like molecular simulations,
													neural nets can have an extremely large number of parameters that can
													be difficult to infer. This project is about applying the kinds of sampling
													methods I'm used to developing and using on molecular dynamics to neural nets.

													One of my main areas of expertise is calculating relative binding free energies,
													which is equivalent to Bayes factors.
