                            and to develop methods that help medicinal chemists decide what

										<h3>Atomistic simulations for drug discovery</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Much of my research revolves around atomistic simulations of biomolecules, which
										include proteins, drugs, solvent (e.g. water), and other small molecules that
										are of biological interest. The simulations model the forces between atoms to
										predict configurations and dynamical processes. These in turn can be used to
										estimate quantities that can be verified (or falsified) experimentally. The
										simulations are atomistic in resolution, giving us an unprecedented level of
										detail on the systems in question. We can use them to generate hypotheses or to
										address questions like ‘how does this particular drug bind?’ and ‘how does this
										particular protein function?’.
									</p>
									<p>
										Despite being simplified models of the atomistic world, the simulations are
										highly complex and time-intensive. For a typically-sized protein immersed in
										water, the simulations have to evaluate the forces between tens of thousands of
										atoms over hundreds of thousands of iterations. Depending on the system and the
										questions one is trying to answer, simulations can take days to months. Despite
										the increasing power of computer processors and smarter use of hardware,
										sampling the important states of the biomolecules still remains a challenge.
										Broadly speaking, the two main problems my field grapples with are 1) improving
										the accuracy of the modelled atomistic forces, and 2) improving the thoroughness
										of the sampling. Much of my research has been on the latter, with particular
										focus on enhancing the sampling of water in buried protein cavities (for
										example, see <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b07940">this paper</a>).
									</p>
									<p>
										I am also interested in reducing the barriers to using atomistic simulations.
										They require expertise to set up, run, and analyse. One large barrier is the
										complexity of the software we use, a problem that is compounded in academic
										research due to the frequent augmentations and modifications that are made to
										the software as the science progresses. This in turn raises issues around the
										sustainability of the software itself. I strive to make all my software easy to
										use, free, open-source, and written in an interpretable way. I am currently a
										developer for <a href="https://www.essexgroup.soton.ac.uk/ProtoMS">ProtoMS</a>
										and work on tools for <a href="https://openmm.org">OpenMM</a>. Another barrier to
										using atomistic simulations is knowing how make reliable inferences from the
										largeand complex data that is produced. It is important to ask the
										<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct4004228">right questions</a>
										from the data, and have the best tools to address them. To this end, I'm very
										interested in statistics (with a Bayesian flavour) and machine learning.
